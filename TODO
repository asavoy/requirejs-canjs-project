DONE: basic production build with grunt build
DONE: load production build
DONE: test relative path to template
DONE: should template plugins force extension or not?
DONE: load CSS
DONE: load static JS and bower components in static folder
DONE: load a page not in the same folder as index.html
DONE: partial templates
DONE: remove steal-start / end things (or whiteout lines?)
DONE: stach templates
DONE: test mustache global helpers
DONE: remember that we use canjs 2.1.4 amd-dev build
DONE: test can view attr -> PIECE OF SHIT kinda working... is there a better way?
DONE: extra plugin pattern; e.g. jquery-migrate, can/map/define
DONE: document how we're not using bower_components in favor of
       committing directly. bower_components becomes really heavy
       due to most packages storing many copies of source files.
       it's hard to avoid clogging up the requirejs build.
DONE: comment up Gruntfile.js
DONE: requirejs optimizer build with common modules vs page-specific
DONE: generate source maps / use uglifyjs2
DONE: add that duplicate finder thing, i think from grunt-contribu-requirejs
DONE: use minified requirejs
DONE: check production build doesn't load extra stuff
